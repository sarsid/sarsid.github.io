I am advised by [Justin Thaler](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/) and [Alexander Golovnev](https://golovnev.org/) and part of a budding [theory](https://cstheory-georgetown.github.io/) group at Georgetown.

I am interested in exploring the power of various classical and quantum models of computation. Recently, I have been thinking about:
- unconditional circuit lower bounds against various models of low-depth circuits.
- various questions surrounding the complexity of algorithms and constructions of classical and quantum codes. 
- algorithms and lower bounds for the AVOID problems which relate to finding explicit constructions for circuit lower bounds, rigid matrices, etc.

Previously, I have been interested in privacy regulation, especially the [GDPR](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-26-GDPR.htm). I encourage checking out the excellent [Bridging Privacy](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/bridging-privacy-definitions) working group. 

I also contributed to (and help setup) the [quantum information package](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-qip) of the popular quantum simulation toolbox [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip). You can read about my implementation of quantum circuit simulation [here](https://sarsid.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/a-gsoc-summary/).
